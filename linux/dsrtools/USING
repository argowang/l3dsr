The dsrtools package provides support for configuring L2DSR and L3DSR
on a server.  By creating a configuration file that is typically stored
in /etc/dsr.d, the DSR configuration is started whenever the host
boots.

dsrtools is supported on RHEL5 and later.

Man pages are available in dsr.conf(5) and dsrctl(8).


Examples

# Start/Stop configured DSRs.
sudo dsrctl start
sudo dsrctl stop

# See commands run when starting/stopping configured DSRs.
sudo dsrctl -v start
sudo dsrctl -v stop

# Display configured DSRs.
sudo dsrctl status
