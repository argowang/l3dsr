Usage: dsrctl [-d <configdir>] [-f <configfile>] [-ahnvx] <action>
       -a       For status, print status for all discovered loopbacks
                and iptables rules, not just configured DSRs.
       -d dir   Specify DSR config directory.  Defaults to /etc/dsr.d.
       -f file  Read a single DSR config from this file.
                The -d option is ignored if -f is used.
       -h       Print a usage statement and exit.
       -n       Don't actually perform the operations.  This option
                is useful with the verbose option.
       -v       Be verbose.  More -v options get more verbose output.
       -x       Don't print the header.
       <action> Run the requested action.  Supported actions are:
                check
                restart
                status
                start
                stop
