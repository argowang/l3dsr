This directory contains tests for L3DSR.  Each subdirectory is a test where
the name identifies whether the test uses IPv4/IPv6/both and L2DSR/L3DSR/both.
	IPv4: ip4
	IPv6: ip6
	both: ip46

	L2DSR: l2
	L3DSR: l3
	both:  l23

The tests exercise the configuration of L3DSR using dsrctl and in so doing,
create and delete iptables rules and loopbacks so the tests should not be run
on a host actively participating in L3DSR.

These tests do not test end-to-end L3DSR functionality where packets are sent
among the participant hosts.  That testing is beyond the scope of this set of
tests.


Run all of the tests using ../../src/dsrctl:
	make

Run all of the tests using specific dsrctl:
	make DSRCTL=<path_to_dsrctl>

Run all of the tests using /usr/sbin/dsrctl:
	make DSRCTL=/usr/sbin/dsrctl

Run the tests in a single directory:
	make DSRCTL=<path_to_dsrctl> mangle-ip46.l23.000.d
	make DSRCTL=<path_to_dsrctl> raw-ip46.l23.000.d

Run the tests in a single directory with verbose output:
	make V=1 DSRCTL=<path_to_dsrctl> mangle-ip46.l23.000.d
	make V=1 DSRCTL=<path_to_dsrctl> raw-ip46.l23.000.d

The Makefile determines whether mangle, raw, or both can be run and runs
the appropriate set of tests unless you specify a particular table.

Each directory of tests contains a tinfo file that provides information about
the tests.  The format of the file is a sourceable ksh file.  It must contain
a line that provides a definition of a TDESC variable that contains a short,
one line description of the tests.  For example,
	TDESC="IPv4 L3DSRs with duplicate DSCPs (dec, oct, hex)"

Additional lines indicate the expected return value of the dsrctl command.
The format of the expected return value variable name is
	TRV_<action>_<testnum>

For example, if the action for the given command is "status", this is test
number 5, and the expected return value is 1, then the following line would be
correct.
	TRV_status_5=1

If the expected return value is 0, then you don't need to specify it in the
tinfo file.
